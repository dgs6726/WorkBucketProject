# Century Mold — Supply Chain Work Bucket Mapping Project

## Project Context

### What This Is
A workshop preparation project for Century Mold's COO-led organizational redesign initiative. The goal is to map the **current state** of supply chain work — who does what — so it can be compared against a proposed future-state org design during a facilitated workshop.

### Company Background
- **Century Mold**: ~$180M automotive manufacturing company (plastics injection molding)
- **6 production sites in North America**: Rochester, Shelbyville, Middletown, Pulaski, Queretaro (Mexico), Chihuahua (Mexico)
- **Serves Tier 1 automotive customers**, build-to-print
- Recently transitioned from geographic to category-based purchasing
- Evolving from centralized to center-led supply chain operations

### The Workshop
- **Sponsor**: Carlos Sanchez, COO
- **Objective**: Identify ideal organizational design, duplication of work, unnecessary coordination, and SG&A reduction opportunities
- **Approach**: Map current-state work buckets with owners → compare to Carlos' proposed future-state org → identify gaps, duplication, unclear ownership

### Carlos' Specific Ask
> Provide "work buckets with current owners" — what the work is, what happens in each bucket, who owns it. He wants to see duplication, confusion, shared ownership, and no ownership. Think about how to represent this visually and clearly.

His example of a "work bucket" was **"Sourcing Materials"** — a Level 2 functional work stream, not a high-level domain (Level 1) or a granular task (Level 3).

### Granularity Framework
| Level | Example | Use |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Level 1 | Supplier Management | Too high — can't assign clear ownership |
| **Level 2** | Supplier Qualification | **Target level for this exercise** |
| Level 3 | Conduct supplier audits | Too granular — mapping hundreds of tasks |

Target: **10–15 work buckets for Supply Chain scope**, with flags for anything that spills across functional boundaries.

## Carlos' Future-State Design (from Visio file)

### Design Philosophy
Carlos organized the COO span around three core value-creating work systems:

1. **Production Execution** → VP Operations (Pinar Sezgen)
2. **Industrialization** → VP Engineering & PM (Eric Uram)
3. **Supply Assurance** → VP Supply Chain (Gavin Simpson)

**Guiding Principles:**
- Each VP role owns a complete work system with measurable outcomes
- Organizational fragmentation that forces coordination must be minimized
- Decision rights must be clear and local — no cross-VP arbitration for routine tradeoffs
- If a function cannot own a full work system, it should not be a VP role
- Simplify the system, not cut muscle
- Scale by adding capacity inside systems, not new systems

### Future-State Supply Chain Org

**VP Supply Chain (Gavin Simpson)** — owns the "source and flow" work system end to end

Carlos' comment:
> "Supply chain is a control tower function. It must make tradeoffs across plants, suppliers, and customers. Fragmenting it creates local optimization and excess inventory, which is pure SG&A leakage. You reduce expediting, premium freight governance, and planning rework. Inventory turns improve without adding planners because policies become explicit and centralized. This VP owns supplier strategy, inventory targets, and material availability. Operations consumes what Supply Chain commits to deliver."

#### Purchasing Manager (Khris Cook)
**Workstream**: Strategic Sourcing & Supplier Performance

Carlos' comment on VP-level ownership:
> "Inventory policy and tradeoffs, make versus buy sourcing strategy, cross-plant material allocation, priority arbitration under constraint."

**Direct Reports:**
- **Jen Albrecht** — Direct Buyer (resins and additives), Category Execution Workstream
- **Daniela Ojeda** — Direct Buyer (components and outsourced ops), Category Execution Workstream
- **Amanda Beeman** — CapEx and Indirect Buyer (global), Indirect and Capital Procurement Workstream

Carlos' comment on buyers:
> "They do not negotiate strategy or override contracts. Day-to-day execution of sourcing strategy, supplier communication and issue resolution."

#### Logistics Manager (Mike Quail)
**Workstream**: Physical Flow & Transportation

Carlos' comment:
> "This must be consolidated globally. Splitting logistics by region almost always inflates cost and obscures root causes."

**Direct Reports:**
- **Jesus Bolivar** — Foreign Trade Specialist (Mexico), Trade Compliance Execution Workstream

#### Supply Planning & Inventory Manager (Martin Munoz)
**Workstream**: Inventory Planning & Availability

Carlos' comment:
> "This role is critical. Without it, Purchasing optimizes cost and Logistics optimizes freight while inventory balloons."

**Direct Reports:**
- **Angelina Sagan** — Planner USA, USA Planning Execution Workstream
- **Planner Mexico** (unnamed) — Mexico Planning Execution Workstream

Carlos' comment on planners:
> "They do not set policy or targets. Execution of planning rules, timely escalation."

### Open Questions from Carlos (noted on Visio Page 2)
1. "Do these positions need to be centralized or do they land under the plant materials manager?" (referring to planners)
2. "Task: Clarify and then simplify the interaction between launch manager and program manager."
3. "Task: Metrology"

- Director of Quality (Zach Parker)
- EH&S Manager (OPEN)
- CI Director (Georgina Arreola)

## Work Bucket Definitions — Current Draft

### Approach to Splitting Buckets
A key design decision was made on how to split purchasing work. Rather than splitting by **category** (what you buy), the split follows **nature of work** (what you're doing):

- **Strategic sourcing** = establish the deal (supplier selection, negotiation, contract establishment, cost optimization). Corporate-level, done once or periodically. Applies across direct, indirect, and CapEx.
- **Tactical purchasing** = execute the deal (releasing against existing agreements, managing POs, expediting, resolving issues). Repetitive, daily, can be decentralized.
- **Planning releases** = scheduling releases against established direct material agreements. This is a planning function, not purchasing. Lives under Planning & Inventory.

## Project Plan

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Finalize work bucket list | **In Progress** — draft complete, needs final review |
| 2 | Map current-state ownership for each bucket | Not Started |
| 3 | Flag issues (duplication, gaps, boundary problems) | Not Started |
| 4 | Build workshop deliverable (visual/structured format) | Not Started |
| 5 | Current vs. future gap notes (optional) | Not Started |

---

## Key Decisions Made
- **Granularity**: Level 2 work streams (e.g., "Supplier Qualification"), not Level 1 domains or Level 3 tasks
- **Scope**: Supply Chain only, not full COO span — but flagging boundary work
- **Purchasing split**: By nature of work (strategic vs. tactical) rather than by spend category (direct vs. indirect)
- **Planning releases**: Classified as a planning function, not purchasing — moved to Pillar 3
